Fall: 9 units
Statistical Computing: An introduction to computing targeted at statistics majors with minimal programming knowledge. The main topics are core ideas of programming (functions, objects, data structures, flow control, input and output, debugging, logical design and abstraction), illustrated through key statistical topics (exploratory data analysis, basic optimization, linear models, graphics, and simulation). The class will be taught in the R language. No previous programming experience required. Pre-requisites: (36-202, 36-208, or 36-309), plus ("computing at Carnegie Mellon" or consent of instructor) and 36-225 co-requisite.

36-625 Probability and Mathematical Statistics I
Prerequisites: 21-123 or 21-256 or 21-118 or 21-122
Fall: 12 units
This course is a rigorous introduction to the mathematical theory of probability, and it provides the necessary background for the study of mathematical statistics and probability modeling. A good working knowledge of calculus is required. Topics include combinatorial analysis, conditional probability, generating functions, sampling distributions, law of large numbers, and the central limit theorem. Undergraduate students studying Computer Science, or considering graduate work in Statistics or Operations Research, must receive permission from their advisor and from the instructor. Prerequisite: 21-122 and 21-241 and (21-256 or 21-259).


36-626 Probability and Mathematical Statistics II
Prerequisite: 36-625
Intermittent: 12 units
An introduction to the mathematical theory of statistical inference. Topics include likelihood functions, estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, Bayesian inference, regression, and the analysis of variance. Not open to students who have received credit for 36-226. Students studying Computer Science should carefully consider taking this course instead of 36-220 or 36-226 after consultation with their advisor. Prerequisite: 36-625.


36-401 Modern Regression
Prerequisites: (36-226 Min. grade C or 36-326 Min. grade C or 36-625 Min. grade C) and (21-241 or 21-240)
Fall: 9 units
This course is an introduction to the real world of statistics and data analysis. We will explore real data sets, examine various models for the data, assess the validity of their assumptions, and determine which conclusions we can make (if any). Data analysis is a bit of an art; there may be several valid approaches. We will strongly emphasize the importance of critical thinking about the data and the question of interest. Our overall goal is to use a basic set of modeling tools to explore and analyze data and to present the results in a scientific report. A minimum grade of C in any one of the pre-requisites is required. A grade of C is required to move on to 36-402 or any 36-46x course.
