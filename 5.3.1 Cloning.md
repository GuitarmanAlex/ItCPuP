during a for loop, the implementation of Python keeps track of where it is in the list using an internal counter that is incremented at the end of each iteration.
when the value of the counter reaches the current length of the list,the loop terminates.
this works as one might expect if the list is not mutated within the loop,but can have surprising consequences if the list is mutated.
as you can see, it is possible to figure out what happens when the list is modified within the loop
